Create a sokoban game clone using your preferred AI provider. 
The player sprite must be able to move in all directions.
Blocks can only be pushed and not pulled. 
Only one block can be pushed at a time.
As you perform this exercise, describe how the AI was able to assist you, and what it failed at doing. Provide 
the prompts you used to arrive at your final answer. Please record a screencast demonstrating a fully 
functioning game. i need to do this part by part i need a function to draw the objects walls and player another to move the player and one to check the win and a main loop using pygame to create the ui 

Perfect, let‚Äôs build this Sokoban clone step by step in **Pygame**.

We‚Äôll structure the game into **four main parts** as you requested:

1. **Drawing function** ‚Üí to render walls, blocks, goals, and the player.
2. **Movement function** ‚Üí to move the player in 4 directions, respecting push rules.
3. **Win check function** ‚Üí to check if all blocks are on goals.
4. **Main loop** ‚Üí to initialize Pygame, handle events, and update the UI.

---

## Step 1 ‚Äì Drawing the objects

Here‚Äôs a starting point with a small grid-based map:

```python
import pygame

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
TILE_SIZE = 50
ROWS, COLS = 8, 8
WIDTH, HEIGHT = COLS * TILE_SIZE, ROWS * TILE_SIZE

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BROWN = (139, 69, 19)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
GREEN = (0, 200, 0)

# Create screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Sokoban Clone")

# Map legend: 
# "#" = wall, "." = goal, "$" = block, "@" = player, " " = empty
level_map = [
    "########",
    "#      #",
    "# .$@  #",
    "#   .  #",
    "#   $  #",
    "#      #",
    "########",
]

# Parse the map into lists
walls, goals, blocks = [], [], []
player = None

for y, row in enumerate(level_map):
    for x, tile in enumerate(row):
        if tile == "#":
            walls.append((x, y))
        elif tile == ".":
            goals.append((x, y))
        elif tile == "$":
            blocks.append((x, y))
        elif tile == "@":
            player = (x, y)

def draw_objects():
    screen.fill(WHITE)

    # Draw walls
    for (x, y) in walls:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, BROWN, (x*TILE_SIZE, y*TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE))

    # Draw goals
    for (x, y) in goals:
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, GREEN, (x*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2, y*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2), TILE_SIZE//4)

    # Draw blocks
    for (x, y) in blocks:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, BLUE, (x*TILE_SIZE+5, y*TILE_SIZE+5, TILE_SIZE-10, TILE_SIZE-10))

    # Draw player
    if player:
        px, py = player
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 0, 0), (px*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2, py*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2), TILE_SIZE//3)

    pygame.display.flip()
```

---

‚úÖ This **first step** will display:

* Brown squares ‚Üí walls
* Green circles ‚Üí goals
* Blue squares ‚Üí blocks
* Red circle ‚Üí player

---

üëâ Do you want me to continue with **Step 2: movement function** next, or do you want to test this drawing part first and confirm the grid is showing correctly?

lets do the level map as a 2d array with numbers each number identifies an object so i can imagine it better 

Got it üëç ‚Äî that will make it much clearer.
We‚Äôll use a **2D integer array** where each number corresponds to an object:

* `0` ‚Üí empty space
* `1` ‚Üí wall
* `2` ‚Üí goal
* `3` ‚Üí block
* `4` ‚Üí player

This way you can visualize the board like a matrix.

## Step 1 (revised with 2D array map)

```python
import pygame

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
TILE_SIZE = 50
ROWS, COLS = 8, 8
WIDTH, HEIGHT = COLS * TILE_SIZE, ROWS * TILE_SIZE

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BROWN = (139, 69, 19)   # Walls
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)      # Blocks
GREEN = (0, 200, 0)     # Goals
RED = (255, 0, 0)       # Player

# Create screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Sokoban Clone")

# Map legend:
# 0 = empty, 1 = wall, 2 = goal, 3 = block, 4 = player
level_map = [
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,0,2,3,4,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,3,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
]

def draw_objects():
    screen.fill(WHITE)

    for y, row in enumerate(level_map):
        for x, tile in enumerate(row):
            rect = (x*TILE_SIZE, y*TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE)

            if tile == 1:  # Wall
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, BROWN, rect)

            elif tile == 2:  # Goal
                pygame.draw.circle(screen, GREEN, (x*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2, y*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2), TILE_SIZE//4)

            elif tile == 3:  # Block
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, BLUE, (x*TILE_SIZE+5, y*TILE_SIZE+5, TILE_SIZE-10, TILE_SIZE-10))

            elif tile == 4:  # Player
                pygame.draw.circle(screen, RED, (x*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2, y*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2), TILE_SIZE//3)

    pygame.display.flip()

# Test loop just to see drawing
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    draw_objects()
```

---

üéØ This version draws directly from the **matrix map**.
Example layout:

```
11111111
10000001
10234001
10002001
10003001
10000001
11111111
```

---

üëâ Do you want me to continue with **Step 2: movement logic** (moving the player & pushing blocks) using this **matrix-based map**?

now movement logic locating the player and winning condition

Perfect üöÄ
Now we‚Äôll add **movement logic** (up/down/left/right), **player locating**, and a **winning check**.
We‚Äôll keep working with the **2D array map**.

---

## Step 2 ‚Äì Movement & Win Condition

Rules:

* Player moves into an **empty space (0)** or a **goal (2)**.
* If moving into a **block (3)**:

  * It only moves if the next tile in that direction is empty (0) or goal (2).
  * Otherwise, the move is blocked.
* Blocks cannot be pulled.
* Win condition: **all goals (2)** must be covered by blocks (3).

### üîë Key Features

* **`find_player()`** ‚Üí finds player‚Äôs position each turn.
* **`move_player(dx, dy)`** ‚Üí applies Sokoban movement rules.
* **`check_win()`** ‚Üí verifies all goals are covered by blocks.
* Player **can‚Äôt walk through walls** or **push two blocks at once**.

üëâ Do you want me to extend this with a **reset/next-level system** after winning, or keep it a single-level working demo for now?

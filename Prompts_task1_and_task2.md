Create a sokoban game clone using your preferred AI provider. 
The player sprite must be able to move in all directions.
Blocks can only be pushed and not pulled. 
Only one block can be pushed at a time.
As you perform this exercise, describe how the AI was able to assist you, and what it failed at doing. Provide 
the prompts you used to arrive at your final answer. Please record a screencast demonstrating a fully 
functioning game. i need to do this part by part i need a function to draw the objects walls and player another to move the player and one to check the win and a main loop using pygame to create the ui 

Perfect, let‚Äôs build this Sokoban clone step by step in **Pygame**.

We‚Äôll structure the game into **four main parts** as you requested:

1. **Drawing function** ‚Üí to render walls, blocks, goals, and the player.
2. **Movement function** ‚Üí to move the player in 4 directions, respecting push rules.
3. **Win check function** ‚Üí to check if all blocks are on goals.
4. **Main loop** ‚Üí to initialize Pygame, handle events, and update the UI.

---

## Step 1 ‚Äì Drawing the objects

Here‚Äôs a starting point with a small grid-based map:

```python
import pygame

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
TILE_SIZE = 50
ROWS, COLS = 8, 8
WIDTH, HEIGHT = COLS * TILE_SIZE, ROWS * TILE_SIZE

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BROWN = (139, 69, 19)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
GREEN = (0, 200, 0)

# Create screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Sokoban Clone")

# Map legend: 
# "#" = wall, "." = goal, "$" = block, "@" = player, " " = empty
level_map = [
    "########",
    "#      #",
    "# .$@  #",
    "#   .  #",
    "#   $  #",
    "#      #",
    "########",
]

# Parse the map into lists
walls, goals, blocks = [], [], []
player = None

for y, row in enumerate(level_map):
    for x, tile in enumerate(row):
        if tile == "#":
            walls.append((x, y))
        elif tile == ".":
            goals.append((x, y))
        elif tile == "$":
            blocks.append((x, y))
        elif tile == "@":
            player = (x, y)

def draw_objects():
    screen.fill(WHITE)

    # Draw walls
    for (x, y) in walls:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, BROWN, (x*TILE_SIZE, y*TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE))

    # Draw goals
    for (x, y) in goals:
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, GREEN, (x*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2, y*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2), TILE_SIZE//4)

    # Draw blocks
    for (x, y) in blocks:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, BLUE, (x*TILE_SIZE+5, y*TILE_SIZE+5, TILE_SIZE-10, TILE_SIZE-10))

    # Draw player
    if player:
        px, py = player
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 0, 0), (px*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2, py*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2), TILE_SIZE//3)

    pygame.display.flip()
```

---

‚úÖ This **first step** will display:

* Brown squares ‚Üí walls
* Green circles ‚Üí goals
* Blue squares ‚Üí blocks
* Red circle ‚Üí player

---

üëâ Do you want me to continue with **Step 2: movement function** next, or do you want to test this drawing part first and confirm the grid is showing correctly?

lets do the level map as a 2d array with numbers each number identifies an object so i can imagine it better 

Got it üëç ‚Äî that will make it much clearer.
We‚Äôll use a **2D integer array** where each number corresponds to an object:

* `0` ‚Üí empty space
* `1` ‚Üí wall
* `2` ‚Üí goal
* `3` ‚Üí block
* `4` ‚Üí player

This way you can visualize the board like a matrix.

## Step 1 (revised with 2D array map)

```python
import pygame

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
TILE_SIZE = 50
ROWS, COLS = 8, 8
WIDTH, HEIGHT = COLS * TILE_SIZE, ROWS * TILE_SIZE

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BROWN = (139, 69, 19)   # Walls
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)      # Blocks
GREEN = (0, 200, 0)     # Goals
RED = (255, 0, 0)       # Player

# Create screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Sokoban Clone")

# Map legend:
# 0 = empty, 1 = wall, 2 = goal, 3 = block, 4 = player
level_map = [
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,0,2,3,4,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,3,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
]

def draw_objects():
    screen.fill(WHITE)

    for y, row in enumerate(level_map):
        for x, tile in enumerate(row):
            rect = (x*TILE_SIZE, y*TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE)

            if tile == 1:  # Wall
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, BROWN, rect)

            elif tile == 2:  # Goal
                pygame.draw.circle(screen, GREEN, (x*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2, y*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2), TILE_SIZE//4)

            elif tile == 3:  # Block
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, BLUE, (x*TILE_SIZE+5, y*TILE_SIZE+5, TILE_SIZE-10, TILE_SIZE-10))

            elif tile == 4:  # Player
                pygame.draw.circle(screen, RED, (x*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2, y*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE//2), TILE_SIZE//3)

    pygame.display.flip()

# Test loop just to see drawing
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    draw_objects()
```

---

üéØ This version draws directly from the **matrix map**.
Example layout:

```
11111111
10000001
10234001
10002001
10003001
10000001
11111111
```

---

üëâ Do you want me to continue with **Step 2: movement logic** (moving the player & pushing blocks) using this **matrix-based map**?

now movement logic locating the player and winning condition

Perfect üöÄ
Now we‚Äôll add **movement logic** (up/down/left/right), **player locating**, and a **winning check**.
We‚Äôll keep working with the **2D array map**.

---

## Step 2 ‚Äì Movement & Win Condition

Rules:

* Player moves into an **empty space (0)** or a **goal (2)**.
* If moving into a **block (3)**:

  * It only moves if the next tile in that direction is empty (0) or goal (2).
  * Otherwise, the move is blocked.
* Blocks cannot be pulled.
* Win condition: **all goals (2)** must be covered by blocks (3).

### üîë Key Features

* **`find_player()`** ‚Üí finds player‚Äôs position each turn.
* **`move_player(dx, dy)`** ‚Üí applies Sokoban movement rules.
* **`check_win()`** ‚Üí verifies all goals are covered by blocks.
* Player **can‚Äôt walk through walls** or **push two blocks at once**.

üëâ Do you want me to extend this with a **reset/next-level system** after winning, or keep it a single-level working demo for now?

Update your game from Task 1 to be a multi-user platform. Users must register and login to play. User 
scores must be stored and a leader-board shown on the landing page. The system should have 3 roles, 
anonymous, player and admin. Admins can create new puzzles and therefore make new levels everyday to 
challenge players. 
As you perform this exercise, describe how the AI was able to assist you, and what it failed at doing. Provide 
the prompts you used to arrive at your final answer. Please record a screencast demonstrating a fully 
functioning system. so now i need to create a main menu screen before playing a button thet starts this when pressed on a page for a leaderboard that stores score as number of moves before win condition is met and a page to create puzzles for admins

Great üëç now we‚Äôre turning your single-player Sokoban into a **multi-user platform with menus, leaderboard, and admin puzzle creation**.
This is a big step, so let‚Äôs break it down cleanly:

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

We‚Äôll need **3 main layers**:

1. **Authentication & Roles**

   * Users can register/login.
   * Roles: `anonymous`, `player`, `admin`.
   * Logged-in users persist across sessions (using a JSON file or SQLite DB).

2. **Game Logic**

   * Same Sokoban core from Task 1.
   * Count number of moves.
   * After `check_win()` ‚Üí record score.

3. **UI Screens (State Machine)**

   * **Main Menu** (buttons: Login/Register, Play, Leaderboard, Exit).
   * **Leaderboard Screen** (shows sorted scores).
   * **Game Screen** (actual Sokoban gameplay).
   * **Puzzle Editor Screen** (admins only ‚Üí create levels).

---

## Step 1 ‚Äì Basic Menu & State Switching

Here‚Äôs a **menu framework** before we add login/leaderboard/puzzle editor.

```python
import pygame
import sys

pygame.init()

# Constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 600, 400
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
BLUE = (0, 120, 255)

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Sokoban Platform")

font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 40)

# Global game state
STATE = "menu"  # menu, game, leaderboard, editor

def draw_text(text, x, y, color=BLACK):
    label = font.render(text, True, color)
    screen.blit(label, (x, y))

def menu_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("Welcome to Sokoban!", 180, 50)
    draw_text("1. Play Game", 200, 150)
    draw_text("2. Leaderboard", 200, 200)
    draw_text("3. Puzzle Editor (Admin)", 200, 250)
    draw_text("4. Exit", 200, 300)
    pygame.display.flip()

def leaderboard_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("Leaderboard (placeholder)", 160, 50)
    draw_text("Press ESC to return", 180, 300)
    pygame.display.flip()

def game_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("Game Screen (placeholder Sokoban)", 100, 150)
    draw_text("Press ESC to return", 180, 300)
    pygame.display.flip()

def editor_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("Puzzle Editor (Admin only)", 140, 150)
    draw_text("Press ESC to return", 180, 300)
    pygame.display.flip()

# Main loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if STATE == "menu":
                if event.key == pygame.K_1:
                    STATE = "game"
                elif event.key == pygame.K_2:
                    STATE = "leaderboard"
                elif event.key == pygame.K_3:
                    STATE = "editor"
                elif event.key == pygame.K_4:
                    running = False
            else:
                if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                    STATE = "menu"

    if STATE == "menu":
        menu_screen()
    elif STATE == "leaderboard":
        leaderboard_screen()
    elif STATE == "game":
        game_screen()
    elif STATE == "editor":
        editor_screen()

pygame.quit()
sys.exit()
```

---

‚úÖ This gives you:

* A **menu screen** with options (Play, Leaderboard, Editor, Exit).
* Switches between states when pressing `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`.
* Press **ESC** in any state to return to the menu.

---

## üîú Next Steps

1. **Add Login/Register system** (JSON file with usernames, passwords, roles).
2. **Integrate Sokoban gameplay** inside `game_screen()` with **move counter**.
3. **Store scores** and display them sorted in `leaderboard_screen()`.
4. **Editor screen** ‚Üí grid builder for admins to design puzzles.

---

üëâ Do you want me to **add the login/register system with roles next** (so that only logged-in users can play and admins can access the editor), or should I first plug the actual Sokoban game into the `game_screen()` with move counting?

i need the play button to run the game.py script on pressing it

Perfect üëç ‚Äî since you already have a **separate `game.py`** file with your Sokoban logic, the simplest way is to make the **menu run `game.py`** when "Play Game" is pressed.

You can do this in two main ways:

---

## üîπ Option 1: Use `subprocess` (recommended)

This will open `game.py` as a **separate process**.

```python
import pygame
import sys
import subprocess

pygame.init()

# Constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 600, 400
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Sokoban Platform")

font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 40)

STATE = "menu"

def draw_text(text, x, y, color=BLACK):
    label = font.render(text, True, color)
    screen.blit(label, (x, y))

def menu_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("Welcome to Sokoban!", 180, 50)
    draw_text("1. Play Game", 200, 150)
    draw_text("2. Leaderboard", 200, 200)
    draw_text("3. Puzzle Editor (Admin)", 200, 250)
    draw_text("4. Exit", 200, 300)
    pygame.display.flip()

def leaderboard_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("Leaderboard (placeholder)", 160, 50)
    draw_text("Press ESC to return", 180, 300)
    pygame.display.flip()

def editor_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("Puzzle Editor (Admin only)", 140, 150)
    draw_text("Press ESC to return", 180, 300)
    pygame.display.flip()

# Main loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if STATE == "menu":
                if event.key == pygame.K_1:  # Play
                    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "game.py"])  # Run game.py
                elif event.key == pygame.K_2:  # Leaderboard
                    STATE = "leaderboard"
                elif event.key == pygame.K_3:  # Editor
                    STATE = "editor"
                elif event.key == pygame.K_4:  # Exit
                    running = False
            else:
                if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                    STATE = "menu"

    if STATE == "menu":
        menu_screen()
    elif STATE == "leaderboard":
        leaderboard_screen()
    elif STATE == "editor":
        editor_screen()

pygame.quit()
sys.exit()
```

---

## üîπ Option 2: `import game`

If you want `game.py` to run **inside the same process**, you can import it:

```python
import game
```

And then inside the menu:

```python
if event.key == pygame.K_1:
    game.run_game()   # assuming game.py has a function run_game()
```

But this requires you to wrap your `game.py` loop in a function like:

```python
def run_game():
    # your sokoban loop here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_game()
```

---

‚úÖ **Recommendation:**
Use **Option 1 (`subprocess`)** first ‚Äî it will launch `game.py` cleanly when "Play" is pressed, without restructuring your existing Sokoban file.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also **make the game return a score (move count)** to the menu so it can update the leaderboard, or for now just launch `game.py` when pressing Play?

okay now i need to store the score each time and save it on the leaderboards do i need to use a database or can i store them in a local file and each time i press the leaderboard button the top 5 scores are taken from the file 

Good question üôå

You **don‚Äôt need a full database** for this ‚Äî a **local file** works perfectly fine for a Sokoban clone.
For small projects like this, you can store scores in:

* **JSON file** ‚Üí structured, easy to read/write.
* **CSV file** ‚Üí good if you want to open it in Excel.
* **SQLite DB** ‚Üí overkill unless you want complex queries or many users.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended: JSON File

We‚Äôll store scores in `scores.json` like this:

```json
[
  {"user": "Ali", "moves": 32},
  {"user": "Sara", "moves": 27},
  {"user": "John", "moves": 41}
]
```

Then each time someone finishes a game:

1. Append their result to the file.
2. Sort by `moves` (smaller = better).
3. Leaderboard screen loads **top 5** scores.

---

### Step 1 ‚Äì Saving Score (inside `game.py`)

At the end of the game when `check_win()` is `True`:

```python
import json
import os

def save_score(username, moves):
    scores_file = "scores.json"
    scores = []

    if os.path.exists(scores_file):
        with open(scores_file, "r") as f:
            try:
                scores = json.load(f)
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                scores = []

    scores.append({"user": username, "moves": moves})

    with open(scores_file, "w") as f:
        json.dump(scores, f, indent=4)
```

Call it when the player wins:

```python
if check_win():
    print("üéâ You Win!")
    save_score("Ali", move_count)   # Replace "Ali" with logged-in username
    running = False
```

---

### Step 2 ‚Äì Reading Leaderboard (inside menu `leaderboard_screen`)

In `menu.py`:

```python
def load_leaderboard():
    try:
        with open("scores.json", "r") as f:
            scores = json.load(f)
            scores.sort(key=lambda x: x["moves"])  # sort by moves (ascending)
            return scores[:5]  # top 5
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return []
```

And then in `leaderboard_screen`:

```python
def leaderboard_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("üèÜ Leaderboard - Top 5", 160, 50)

    scores = load_leaderboard()
    y = 120
    for i, entry in enumerate(scores, start=1):
        draw_text(f"{i}. {entry['user']} - {entry['moves']} moves", 150, y)
        y += 40

    draw_text("Press ESC to return", 180, 350)
    pygame.display.flip()
```

---

## üîë Flow Now

1. **Play Game** ‚Üí runs `game.py`.
2. On win ‚Üí calls `save_score(username, moves)`.
3. **Leaderboard button** ‚Üí loads from `scores.json`, shows top 5.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also add a **Login/Register system** so that the username is automatically filled when saving the score, instead of hardcoding `"Ali"`?


i want to calculate move count each time a button from the arrows is pressed this is the main loop should i add in each one move_count++?

Exactly üí° ‚Äî the simplest way to count moves in Sokoban is to **increment `move_count` every time the player successfully makes a move**.

But there‚Äôs a small nuance:

* If the key is pressed but the player **hits a wall** (no movement happens), it **shouldn‚Äôt** count as a move.
* If the player actually **moves into empty/goal** or **pushes a block**, then we increment.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix: Increment inside `move_player`

Instead of putting `move_count += 1` in every key event, add it **inside your `move_player(dx, dy)`** function, **only if movement happened**.

### Example update

```python
move_count = 0

def move_player(dx, dy
```

while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                move(0, -1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                move(0, 1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                move(-1, 0)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                move(1, 0)

    screen.fill(BLACK)
    draw_level(screen)

    if check_win():
        save_score("Ali", move_count)
        font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 60)
        text = font.render("You Win!", True, (255, 215, 0))
        screen.blit(text, (WIDTH//2 - 100, HEIGHT//2 - 30))

    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(FPS)


Thanks for sharing your loop üëå

Right now you‚Äôre calling `move(dx, dy)` directly on arrow keys, but your **`move_count` won‚Äôt increment** unless you explicitly add it.

‚ö†Ô∏è However, don‚Äôt just do `move_count += 1` in the `KEYDOWN` block ‚Üí that would count **even when the move is invalid** (e.g., hitting a wall).

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Way

Modify your `move()` function so it **returns `True` if the move actually happened** and `False` otherwise. Then increment `move_count` only if it was successful.

### Example:

```python
move_count = 0

def move(dx, dy):
    global level_map, move_count
    px, py = find_player()
    nx, ny = px + dx, py + dy   # next position

    # Wall check
    if level_map[ny][nx] == 1:
        return False  

    # Empty or goal ‚Üí move player
    if level_map[ny][nx] in (0, 2):
        level_map[py][px] = 0 if (px, py) not in goals else 2
        level_map[ny][nx] = 4
        move_count += 1
        return True

    # Block ‚Üí can we push it?
    if level_map[ny][nx] == 3:
        bx, by = nx + dx, ny + dy
        if level_map[by][bx] in (0, 2):
            level_map[by][bx] = 3
            level_map[ny][nx] = 4
            level_map[py][px] = 0 if (px, py) not in goals else 2
            move_count += 1
            return True

    return False
```

---

## üîÑ Main Loop Integration

Now your loop stays almost the same, but you don‚Äôt need to touch `move_count` there:

```python
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                move(0, -1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                move(0, 1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                move(-1, 0)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                move(1, 0)

    screen.fill(BLACK)
    draw_level(screen)

    if check_win():
        save_score("Ali", move_count)
        font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 60)
        text = font.render("You Win!", True, (255, 215, 0))
        screen.blit(text, (WIDTH//2 - 100, HEIGHT//2 - 30))

    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(FPS)
```

---

üëâ This way:

* Moves only count when **player or block actually moves**.
* If you press against a wall ‚Üí no increment.

Do you also want me to add a **live move counter display on the screen** (like `Moves: 12`) while the game runs?

def move(dx, dy):
    global level
    x, y = find_player()
    target_x, target_y = x + dx, y + dy
    beyond_x, beyond_y = x + 2*dx, y + 2*dy

    # Helper to check if tile is target underneath
    def is_target(tile):
        return tile in (4, 5, 6)

    current_tile = level[y][x]
    target_tile = level[target_y][target_x]

    # If wall ‚Üí stop
    if target_tile == 1:
        return

    # If block
    if target_tile in (3, 5):
        beyond_tile = level[beyond_y][beyond_x]
        if beyond_tile in (0, 4):  # empty or target
            # Move block
            level[beyond_y][beyond_x] = 5 if beyond_tile == 4 else 3
            # Move player
            level[target_y][target_x] = 6 if target_tile == 5 else 2
            # Leave behind correct tile
            level[y][x] = 4 if current_tile == 6 else 0
    # If empty or target
    elif target_tile in (0, 4):
        level[target_y][target_x] = 6 if target_tile == 4 else 2
        level[y][x] = 4 if current_tile == 6 else 0


Nice üëç you already have a clean **move()** implementation with special tile codes.
Now we just need to add **move counting** so it only increments when a valid move actually occurs.

---

## üîë Strategy

* `move()` should **return `True` if a move happened**, `False` otherwise.
* Increment `move_count` **only when return is True**.

---

### Updated `move()`

```python
def move(dx, dy):
    global level
    x, y = find_player()
    target_x, target_y = x + dx, y + dy
    beyond_x, beyond_y = x + 2*dx, y + 2*dy

    current_tile = level[y][x]
    target_tile = level[target_y][target_x]

    # Wall ‚Üí no move
    if target_tile == 1:
        return False

    # If block
    if target_tile in (3, 5):
        beyond_tile = level[beyond_y][beyond_x]
        if beyond_tile in (0, 4):  # empty or target
            # Move block
            level[beyond_y][beyond_x] = 5 if beyond_tile == 4 else 3
            # Move player
            level[target_y][target_x] = 6 if target_tile == 5 else 2
            # Leave behind correct tile
            level[y][x] = 4 if current_tile == 6 else 0
            return True
        return False  # block can‚Äôt move ‚Üí invalid

    # If empty or target
    elif target_tile in (0, 4):
        level[target_y][target_x] = 6 if target_tile == 4 else 2
        level[y][x] = 4 if current_tile == 6 else 0
        return True

    return False
```

---

### Main Loop Update

```python
move_count = 0

while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            moved = False
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                moved = move(0, -1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                moved = move(0, 1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                moved = move(-1, 0)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                moved = move(1, 0)

            if moved:  # ‚úÖ only count real moves
                move_count += 1

    screen.fill(BLACK)
    draw_level(screen)

    # Display move counter
    font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 30)
    text = font.render(f"Moves: {move_count}", True, (255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(text, (10, 10))

    if check_win():
        save_score("Ali", move_count)
        font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 60)
        text = font.render("You Win!", True, (255, 215, 0))
        screen.blit(text, (WIDTH//2 - 100, HEIGHT//2 - 30))

    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(FPS)
```

---

‚úÖ Now:

* Moves are **only counted when valid** (walking into walls doesn‚Äôt increase).
* Counter is displayed at the top-left (`Moves: X`).
* When winning ‚Üí score is saved correctly with move count.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also update `save_score()` so it saves **username + moves + timestamp**, so the leaderboard looks richer?

the moves is added infite time until i stop running


Ah, I see what‚Äôs happening ‚ö†Ô∏è

Right now your `move()` modifies the board **every frame**, but you‚Äôre calling it inside the loop without checking if the key was just pressed.
So as long as you keep holding an arrow key, it keeps firing and adding to `move_count` every tick ‚Üí giving you "infinite" moves.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix

You only want to increment **once per key press**, not continuously while the key is held.
In **Pygame**, that means you must use `KEYDOWN` events (not continuous polling) ‚Äî which you already do.

But: in your posted loop, you probably put `move_count += 1` outside of the `KEYDOWN` check, or your `move()` is always returning `True`.

---

### Correct Pattern

```python
move_count = 0

while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:   # ‚úÖ only triggers once per press
            moved = False
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                moved = move(0, -1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                moved = move(0, 1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                moved = move(-1, 0)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                moved = move(1, 0)

            if moved:        # ‚úÖ increment only if move was successful
                move_count += 1
```

---

### Double-check `move()`

Make sure your `move()` **returns `True` only when the player actually changes position**.
For example, if you push against a wall or blocked block, it should return `False`.

If you accidentally left `return True` at the end unconditionally, it will always increase.
Your last `move()` version was almost correct ‚Äî just confirm the **return paths** are like this:

```python
# Wall
if target_tile == 1:
    return False

# Block
if target_tile in (3, 5):
    beyond_tile = level[beyond_y][beyond_x]
    if beyond_tile in (0, 4):
        # move block and player
        return True
    return False  # ‚ùå can‚Äôt push ‚Üí don‚Äôt count move

# Empty or goal
elif target_tile in (0, 4):
    # move player
    return True

return False  # fallback
```

---

## üîë TL;DR

* Keep `move_count += 1` inside the `KEYDOWN` event only.
* Ensure `move()` returns `True` **only when a real move happens**.

---

üëâ Do you want me to patch your exact `move()` function so it never ‚Äúleaks‚Äù a `True` return (which might be why it‚Äôs counting infinitely)?


no i think its a problem with the while loop no stopping as it while true


Ahhh I get what you mean now üëç

The `while True:` loop itself is fine ‚Äî **that‚Äôs how every Pygame game runs** (the infinite loop is your game loop).
The problem isn‚Äôt that the loop doesn‚Äôt stop, it‚Äôs that your **`move_count` increments multiple times per key press** because Pygame by default can treat a **held-down key** like repeated presses (key repeat).

---

## üîë Fix 1: Disable Key Repeat

Add this after `pygame.init()`:

```python
pygame.key.set_repeat(0)  # disable repeating keydown events
```

This way, holding down the arrow key won‚Äôt spam moves ‚Äî only one `KEYDOWN` is fired per press.

---

## üîë Fix 2: Count moves only when `KEYDOWN` event happens

Make sure your `move_count` increment is **inside** the `KEYDOWN` event:

```python
elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
    moved = False
    if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
        moved = move(0, -1)
    elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
        moved = move(0, 1)
    elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
        moved = move(-1, 0)
    elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
        moved = move(1, 0)

    if moved:  
        move_count += 1   # ‚úÖ only once per key press
```

---

## üîë Fix 3 (Optional): Control Repeat Delay

If you actually want held keys to move slowly (like continuous walking), you can control repeat:

```python
pygame.key.set_repeat(200, 150)  # (delay, interval in ms)
```

* First number = how long you need to hold the key before it repeats.
* Second number = how fast it repeats after that.

---

‚úÖ Recommendation:
For Sokoban, it‚Äôs usually better to **disable repeat** (`pygame.key.set_repeat(0)`), so each press is exactly **one move**.

---

üëâ Do you want me to update your full `while True:` loop with the **fixed `move_count` logic and key repeat off**, so it‚Äôs copy-paste ready?


why dont we do while running and stop running when we win rather than while true

Yes üëå that‚Äôs actually the **better game loop pattern** in Pygame.

`while True:` is common in small demos, but for real games you should use a **boolean flag** like `running = True`.
Then you can cleanly stop the loop when the player quits **or when they win**.

---

## ‚úÖ Example with `while running`

```python
running = True
move_count = 0

while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False   # stop game loop

        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            moved = False
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                moved = move(0, -1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                moved = move(0, 1)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                moved = move(-1, 0)
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                moved = move(1, 0)

            if moved:
                move_count += 1

    screen.fill(BLACK)
    draw_level(screen)

    # Display move counter
    font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 30)
    text = font.render(f"Moves: {move_count}", True, (255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(text, (10, 10))

    if check_win():
        save_score("Ali", move_count)
        font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 60)
        text = font.render("You Win!", True, (255, 215, 0))
        screen.blit(text, (WIDTH//2 - 100, HEIGHT//2 - 30))
        pygame.display.flip()

        pygame.time.wait(2000)  # show win screen for 2 sec
        running = False         # ‚úÖ exit game loop

    pygame.display.flip()
    clock.tick(FPS)

pygame.quit()
```

---

### üîë What Changed

* Replaced `while True:` ‚Üí `while running:`.
* `running = False` when:

  * Player clicks **close window**.
  * Player **wins the game**.
* After loop ends ‚Üí `pygame.quit()` cleans up.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also make it so that **after winning**, it returns to the **main menu** instead of closing the game completely?

now we need to add the scores from json file when we press on leaderboard button


Perfect üëç now that your game is saving scores with `save_score("Ali", move_count)`, let‚Äôs wire up the **Leaderboard button** in your menu so it pulls from the JSON file and displays the **Top 5 players**.

---

## 1. JSON Score Format

Your `scores.json` will look like this after a few wins:

```json
[
  {"user": "Ali", "moves": 22},
  {"user": "Sara", "moves": 18},
  {"user": "John", "moves": 31}
]
```

---

## 2. Loading Scores (menu.py)

Add a helper function:

```python
import json

def load_leaderboard():
    try:
        with open("scores.json", "r") as f:
            scores = json.load(f)
            # sort by moves (ascending = fewer moves is better)
            scores.sort(key=lambda x: x["moves"])
            return scores[:5]  # top 5
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return []
```

---

## 3. Display Leaderboard

Update your `leaderboard_screen()` function:

```python
def leaderboard_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text("üèÜ Leaderboard - Top 5", 160, 50)

    scores = load_leaderboard()
    if not scores:
        draw_text("No scores yet!", 200, 150)
    else:
        y = 120
        for i, entry in enumerate(scores, start=1):
            draw_text(f"{i}. {entry['user']} - {entry['moves']} moves", 150, y)
            y += 40

    draw_text("Press ESC to return", 180, 350)
    pygame.display.flip()
```

---

## 4. Flow

* After winning in `game.py`, `save_score(username, move_count)` appends to `scores.json`.
* When you go to the **Leaderboard menu option**, it loads that file, sorts by moves, and shows the **Top 5**.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also make it so the **username is taken from a login system** instead of being hardcoded as `"Ali"` when saving the score?

now we need to create a login and sign up page and continue as guest we can either do it in the same screen of the main menu then change it when we login and show the create puzzle part if the username is admin that button should only show when admin logs in it should always show either we create an inital screen and open the main menu from it or change that manin menu to start as login and signup first i prefer the first option though

i want a new script for login and register

Perfect üëç splitting login/register into a **separate script** will make your project cleaner and modular.
Let‚Äôs call it **`login.py`**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure (suggested)

```
sokoban/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login.py        # handles login/register/guest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ menu.py         # shows menu after login
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.py         # runs the actual Sokoban game
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users.json      # stores registered users
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scores.json     # stores leaderboard scores
```

---

## üîë login.py

This script:

* Starts first.
* Shows Login, Register, Guest options.
* Reads/writes `users.json`.
* After successful login/signup/guest, it launches **`menu.py`** and passes the user info (via JSON).

```python

## üîë menu.py (reads session.json)

At the start of your `menu.py`:

```python
import json

SESSION_FILE = "session.json"

with open(SESSION_FILE, "r") as f:
    current_user = json.load(f)

print("Logged in as:", current_user)
```

Then you can show/hide the **Puzzle Editor** button if `current_user["role"] == "admin"`.

---

‚úÖ With this setup:

* You run `python login.py` to start the system.
* Choose login/register/guest.
* `session.json` stores the logged-in user.
* `menu.py` uses that info to display the correct menu.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also add a **text input box** to `login.py` so you can type usernames & passwords instead of the hardcoded `"Ali" / "pass"`?

make it look better make places to write in the username and password when registering or loging in 


Perfect üëå let‚Äôs turn your **`login.py`** into a proper login/register screen with **text input boxes** for username and password.

We‚Äôll use a simple **input box class** in Pygame so the user can actually type text.

## üñ•Ô∏è How it Works

* Start in **Login Screen**.
* Type username & password into text boxes.
* Press **Enter** ‚Üí tries to log in.
* Press **TAB** ‚Üí switches to **Register Screen**.
* Register saves user to `users.json`.
* Login creates a `session.json` and then runs `menu.py`.

---

‚úÖ This gives you proper text entry for login/register.
üëâ Do you want me to also add a **"Continue as Guest" button** at the bottom of the login screen?


i need to send the user to the save scores function so that in the leaderboard its saved with it


Exactly üëç right now your **game** always saves scores with `"Ali"` hardcoded.
We need to replace that with the **logged-in user** from your `login.py`.

---

## üîë How to Pass the Logged-in User

We‚Äôre already writing the logged-in user to `session.json` in `login.py`.
Example `session.json` after login:

```json
{"username": "Ali", "role": "player"}
```

So inside `game.py`, instead of hardcoding `"Ali"`, you can **read from that file**.

---

## üõ† Update in `game.py`

At the **top** of `game.py`, add:

```python
import json

SESSION_FILE = "session.json"

def get_current_user():
    try:
        with open(SESSION_FILE, "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
```

---

When the player wins:

```python
if check_win():
    user = get_current_user()
    save_score(user["username"], move_count)  # ‚úÖ now saves actual logged-in user
    font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 60)
    text = font.render("You Win!", True, (255, 215, 0))
    screen.blit(text, (WIDTH//2 - 100, HEIGHT//2 - 30))
    pygame.display.flip()
    pygame.time.wait(2000)
    running = False
```

---

## üèÜ Result

* **Guest players** will be saved as `"guest"`.
* **Registered players** will be saved under their username.
* Leaderboard now shows **username + moves** for the correct player.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also make the leaderboard show **role** (e.g., `"Ali (player)"`, `"admin"`, `"guest"`) or keep it just username + moves?

now we need to make that the option of the admin only shows when admin is logged in

Perfect üëç that‚Äôs exactly how we enforce **roles**.

Right now your `menu.py` always shows the same menu. We just need to **read `session.json`** and hide/show the **Puzzle Editor** option depending on the logged-in user‚Äôs role.

---

## üîë Step 1: Load Current User in `menu.py`

At the top of `menu.py`:

```python
import json

SESSION_FILE = "session.json"

def get_current_user():
    try:
        with open(SESSION_FILE, "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}

current_user = get_current_user()
```

---

## üîë Step 2: Role-Aware Menu

Update your `menu_screen()` function:

```python
def menu_screen():
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    draw_text(f"Logged in as: {current_user['username']} ({current_user['role']})", 120, 40)
    draw_text("1. Play Game", 200, 120)
    draw_text("2. Leaderboard", 200, 170)

    if current_user["role"] == "admin":  # ‚úÖ Only admins see this
        draw_text("3. Puzzle Editor (Admin)", 200, 220)
        draw_text("4. Logout", 200, 270)
        draw_text("5. Exit", 200, 320)
    else:
        draw_text("3. Logout", 200, 220)
        draw_text("4. Exit", 200, 270)

    pygame.display.flip()
```

---

## üîë Step 3: Handle Input

When processing key presses:

```python
if STATE == "menu":
    if event.key == pygame.K_1:  # Play
        subprocess.run([sys.executable, "game.py"])
    elif event.key == pygame.K_2:  # Leaderboard
        STATE = "leaderboard"
    elif event.key == pygame.K_3:
        if current_user["role"] == "admin":
            STATE = "editor"  # Puzzle Editor
        else:
            # Logout
            current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
            with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
                json.dump(current_user, f)
            STATE = "login"
    elif event.key == pygame.K_4:
        if current_user["role"] == "admin":
            # Logout
            current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
            with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
                json.dump(current_user, f)
            STATE = "login"
        else:
            running = False
    elif event.key == pygame.K_5 and current_user["role"] == "admin":
        running = False
```

---

## ‚úÖ Result

* **Admin login:** sees **Puzzle Editor** button.
* **Normal player/guest:** never sees Puzzle Editor.
* **Logout** resets session back to guest.

---

üëâ Do you also want me to show you how to implement a **basic Puzzle Editor screen** (grid where admin can place walls, blocks, goals, player and save it as a new level)?

we need to do when state is logout to close the main menu tab

Got it üëç if you want **logging out** to fully exit the **main menu** window instead of just switching state back to `"login"`, you can do it simply by stopping the `while running` loop.

---

## ‚úÖ Example Update in `menu.py`

Inside your event handling:

```python
elif event.key == pygame.K_3:  # Logout (for non-admins)
    running = False  # ‚úÖ closes the menu window completely

elif event.key == pygame.K_4:  # Logout (for admins)
    if current_user["role"] == "admin":
        running = False  # ‚úÖ closes the menu window completely
```

---

## üîë Why This Works

* `running = False` ends your `while running:` loop.
* After the loop ends, `pygame.quit()` is called ‚Üí window closes.
* If you want to **return back to login.py** after logout, you can launch it again with `subprocess` just like you do for `game.py`.

---

## üîÑ If You Want to Re-Open Login Instead of Just Closing

Replace `running = False` with:

```python
subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])
running = False
```

This way the menu closes, and the **login screen** opens again.

---

üëâ Do you want logout to **close the whole program** or to **return the user back to login.py** automatically?

running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if STATE == "menu":
                if event.key == pygame.K_1:  # Play
                    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "game.py"])
                elif event.key == pygame.K_2:  # Leaderboard
                    STATE = "leaderboard"
                elif event.key == pygame.K_3:
                    if current_user["role"] == "admin":
                        STATE = "editor"  # Puzzle Editor
                    else:
                        # Logout
                        current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
                        with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
                            json.dump(current_user, f)
                        STATE = "login"
                elif event.key == pygame.K_4:
                    if current_user["role"] == "admin":
                        # Logout
                        current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
                        with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
                            json.dump(current_user, f)
                        STATE = "login"
                    else:
                        running = False
                elif event.key == pygame.K_5 and current_user["role"] == "admin":
                    running = False

    if STATE == "menu":
        menu_screen()
    elif STATE == "leaderboard":
        leaderboard_screen()
    elif STATE == "editor":
        editor_screen()

I see what‚Äôs happening üëå

Right now in your **logout branches**, you‚Äôre setting:

```python
STATE = "login"
```

But your `menu.py` doesn‚Äôt actually have a `"login"` state/screen ‚Üí so the window just hangs open.

If the goal is:

* **Logout closes the menu window** and
* (Optionally) sends the user back to `login.py`

We need to replace those `"login"` assignments with a **window close**.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix for Logout

Update your logout blocks:

```python
elif event.key == pygame.K_3:
    if current_user["role"] == "admin":
        STATE = "editor"  # Puzzle Editor
    else:
        # Logout ‚Üí close menu and go back to login.py
        current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
        with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
            json.dump(current_user, f)
        running = False
        subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])  # optional reopen login

elif event.key == pygame.K_4:
    if current_user["role"] == "admin":
        # Logout ‚Üí close menu and go back to login.py
        current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
        with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
            json.dump(current_user, f)
        running = False
        subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])  # optional reopen login
    else:
        running = False
```

---

## üîë Explanation

* `running = False` cleanly ends your `while running:` loop ‚Üí closes menu window.
* If you want to **exit completely**, just stop there.
* If you want to **return to login**, add:

  ```python
  subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])
  ```

---

üëâ Do you want logout to **return to login.py** (restart flow) or just **exit the program entirely**?

i need to make sure when we login it closes the login window and when we logout it reopens it

Got it ‚úÖ

Right now you‚Äôre using **`subprocess.run([sys.executable, "menu.py"])`** inside `login.py`, and the same trick in `menu.py` to call `login.py` again.

The issue is:

* When you launch `menu.py`, your `login.py` window is still running in the background.
* When you logout, you want the menu window to close completely and **reopen login.py** in a new window.

---

## üîë Fix the Flow

### In **`login.py`**

When a login is successful (or guest is chosen):

1. Save user in `session.json`.
2. Close login window.
3. Launch menu.

```python
if state == "login":
    if event.key == pygame.K_RETURN:
        username = username_box.text.strip()
        password = password_box.text.strip()
        user = authenticate(username, password)
        if user:
            with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
                json.dump(user, f)
            running = False   # ‚úÖ stop login loop
            pygame.quit()     # ‚úÖ close login window
            subprocess.run([sys.executable, "menu.py"])
```

For guest:

```python
elif event.key == pygame.K_g:  # press G for guest
    user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
    with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
        json.dump(user, f)
    running = False
    pygame.quit()
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "menu.py"])
```

---

### In **`menu.py`**

When logout is chosen:

1. Save `guest` in session.
2. Close menu window.
3. Launch login again.

```python
elif event.key == pygame.K_3:
    if current_user["role"] == "admin":
        STATE = "editor"
    else:
        # Logout (guest/player)
        current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
        with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
            json.dump(current_user, f)
        running = False
        pygame.quit()   # ‚úÖ close menu window
        subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])
```

For admin logout:

```python
elif event.key == pygame.K_4 and current_user["role"] == "admin":
    current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
    with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
        json.dump(current_user, f)
    running = False
    pygame.quit()
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])
```

---

## ‚úÖ Result

* **Login/Guest:** login window **closes** and menu opens.
* **Logout:** menu window **closes** and login window reopens.
* No duplicate windows stay open.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also add a **‚ÄúContinue as Guest‚Äù button** to the login screen UI, instead of pressing a hidden key like `G`?

now on logout it has to close the main menu first then reopen login page
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if STATE == "menu":
                if event.key == pygame.K_1:  # Play

                    STATE = "leaderboard"

                        subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])  # go back to login

                elif event.key == pygame.K_4:
                    if current_user["role"] == "admin":

                elif event.key == pygame.K_5 and current_user["role"] == "admin":
                    # Exit (for admins)
                    running = False

            else:  # In leaderboard or editor
                if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                    STATE = "menu"

    # State rendering
    if STATE == "menu":
        menu_screen()
    elif STATE == "leaderboard":
        leaderboard_screen()
    elif STATE == "editor":
        editor_screen()

pygame.quit()


pygame.quit()
sys.exit()

Perfect, thanks for pasting your loop üëå

The main issue is this part:

```python
running = False
subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])  # go back to login
```

When Python hits `subprocess.run()`, your menu window is **still alive** because `pygame.quit()` hasn‚Äôt been called yet.
That‚Äôs why you sometimes see two windows overlapping.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix

To guarantee the menu window closes first and only then reopens the login window, you need to:

1. Call `pygame.quit()` **before** launching `login.py`.
2. Optionally call `sys.exit()` if you don‚Äôt want any leftover code to run.

---

### Updated Logout Blocks

```python
elif event.key == pygame.K_3:
    if current_user["role"] == "admin":
        STATE = "editor"  # Puzzle Editor
    else:
        # Logout (guest/player)
        current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
        with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
            json.dump(current_user, f)
        running = False
        pygame.quit()   # ‚úÖ close menu window
        subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])
        sys.exit()      # ‚úÖ ensure menu script ends

elif event.key == pygame.K_4:
    if current_user["role"] == "admin":
        # Logout (admin)
        current_user = {"username": "guest", "role": "anonymous"}
        with open(SESSION_FILE, "w") as f:
            json.dump(current_user, f)
        running = False
        pygame.quit()   # ‚úÖ close menu window
        subprocess.run([sys.executable, "login.py"])
        sys.exit()
    else:
        # Exit (for players/guests)
        running = False
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Touch

At the very end of the file you already have:

```python
pygame.quit()
sys.exit()
```

That‚Äôs fine ‚Äî but with the new `sys.exit()` in logout, the program will terminate immediately after reopening `login.py`, so you won‚Äôt risk reopening with the old menu still hanging.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also make it so when logging out, the **login screen opens in the *same* window** (without closing and launching a subprocess)? That would avoid having multiple Python processes running.

now i need to add the page where the admin creates a new level


Nice üí° now you‚Äôre at the fun part: giving **admins** the ability to create Sokoban levels.

We‚Äôll add an **Editor screen** (`STATE = "editor"`) in `menu.py` where the admin can place objects (walls, blocks, goals, player) on a grid and save it as a JSON level file.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Design of the Editor Page

* **Grid:** 8√ó8 or 10√ó10 tiles (same size as your levels).
* **Controls:**

  * Left click ‚Üí place currently selected object.
  * Right click ‚Üí clear a tile (set to empty).
  * Number keys (`1‚Äì5`) or keys (`W, B, G, P, E`) ‚Üí switch between object types:

    * `1 / W` ‚Üí Wall
    * `2 / G` ‚Üí Goal
    * `3 / B` ‚Üí Block
    * `4 / P` ‚Üí Player
    * `0 / E` ‚Üí Empty
* **Save Button:** Press `S` ‚Üí saves the grid into `levels.json`.
* **Exit:** Press `ESC` ‚Üí return to menu.

---

## üîë Data Format for Levels

We‚Äôll save all levels in a `levels.json` file like this:

```json
[
  [
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,0,2,3,4,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,3,0,0,1],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
  ]
]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example Editor Screen (`menu.py`)

Add this function:

```python
import json

LEVEL_FILE = "levels.json"

def editor_screen():
    grid_size = 8
    tile_size = 50
    grid = [[0 for _ in range(grid_size)] for _ in range(grid_size)]
    selected = 1  # start with wall

    editing = True
    while editing:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                editing = False
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                    editing = False
                elif event.key == pygame.K_0:
                    selected = 0
                elif event.key == pygame.K_1:
                    selected = 1
                elif event.key == pygame.K_2:
                    selected = 2
                elif event.key == pygame.K_3:
                    selected = 3
                elif event.key == pygame.K_4:
                    selected = 4
                elif event.key == pygame.K_s:
                    save_level(grid)
            elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                x, y = event.pos
                gx, gy = x // tile_size, y // tile_size
                if 0 <= gx < grid_size and 0 <= gy < grid_size:
                    if event.button == 1:  # left click
                        grid[gy][gx] = selected
                    elif event.button == 3:  # right click clears
                        grid[gy][gx] = 0

        # Draw editor grid
        screen.fill(WHITE)
        for y in range(grid_size):
            for x in range(grid_size):
                rect = pygame.Rect(x*tile_size, y*tile_size, tile_size, tile_size)
                val = grid[y][x]
                if val == 1:  # Wall
                    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (139, 69, 19), rect)
                elif val == 2:  # Goal
                    pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0, 200, 0), rect.center, tile_size//4)
                elif val == 3:  # Block
                    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0, 0, 255), rect.inflate(-10, -10))
                elif val == 4:  # Player
                    pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 0, 0), rect.center, tile_size//3)
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, (200,200,200), rect, 1)  # grid lines

        draw_text(f"Selected: {selected}", 400, 50)
        draw_text("Press S to Save, ESC to Exit", 300, 350)
        pygame.display.flip()
```

---

## Save Function

```python
def save_level(grid):
    try:
        with open(LEVEL_FILE, "r") as f:
            levels = json.load(f)
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        levels = []

    levels.append(grid)

    with open(LEVEL_FILE, "w") as f:
        json.dump(levels, f, indent=4)

    print("‚úÖ Level saved!")
```

---

## üîë Flow

1. Only **admin** sees the Editor in menu.
2. In the editor:

   * Use mouse clicks to place objects.
   * Use `0‚Äì4` keys to switch objects.
   * Press **S** to save to `levels.json`.
   * Press **ESC** to go back to menu.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also show you how to **load levels from `levels.json` into the game** so that every time you save a new one, it becomes playable automatically?

i want to make it so that the json file has one level and each time the admin changes it it overwrites the old one and that level is taken from the json file


Perfect üëç that makes it simpler ‚Äî instead of storing **many levels** in `levels.json`, you only keep **one current level**.
When the admin saves from the editor, it **overwrites** the file.
When the player starts the game, it always **loads that JSON level**.

---

## üîë Step 1 ‚Äì Editor Save (Overwrite JSON)

Replace the `save_level()` function with:

```python
def save_level(grid):
    # Always overwrite with the new level
    with open(LEVEL_FILE, "w") as f:
        json.dump(grid, f, indent=4)
    print("‚úÖ Level saved (overwritten)")
```

So now `levels.json` looks like:

```json
[
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,2,3,4,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,3,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
]
```

---

## üîë Step 2 ‚Äì Game Loads Level from JSON

In `game.py`, instead of a hardcoded `level_map`, load it from the file:

```python
LEVEL_FILE = "levels.json"

def load_level():
    with open(LEVEL_FILE, "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)

level_map = load_level()
```

Now your Sokoban game always plays the latest level that the admin saved.

---

## üîë Step 3 ‚Äì Editor Usage Recap

* Only **admin** can access the editor (already handled in `menu_screen`).
* Admin places tiles with mouse + keyboard (0‚Äì4).
* Press `S` ‚Üí saves level to `levels.json`, overwriting old one.
* Players ‚Üí when they choose Play, the game loads `levels.json` and runs that board.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Flow

1. Admin logs in ‚Üí goes to **Puzzle Editor**.
2. Builds a new level ‚Üí presses `S` ‚Üí old `levels.json` replaced.
3. Any player (or guest) ‚Üí presses Play ‚Üí `game.py` loads the JSON and plays the new level.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also add a **visual preview** of the saved level in the leaderboard/menu (so players can see the daily challenge board before starting)?

i want to write down on the write under selected what each number represents


Perfect üëç you can add a **legend** under the ‚ÄúSelected‚Äù text so the admin knows which number corresponds to which object.

---

## ‚úÖ Update in `editor_screen()`

Right after this line:

```python
draw_text(f"Selected: {selected}", 400, 50)
```

Add the legend:

```python
draw_text("0: Empty", 400, 90)
draw_text("1: Wall", 400, 130)
draw_text("2: Goal", 400, 170)
draw_text("3: Block", 400, 210)
draw_text("4: Player", 400, 250)
```

---

## üîë Full Example (bottom of your loop)

```python
        draw_text(f"Selected: {selected}", 400, 50)
        draw_text("0: Empty", 400, 90)
        draw_text("1: Wall", 400, 130)
        draw_text("2: Goal", 400, 170)
        draw_text("3: Block", 400, 210)
        draw_text("4: Player", 400, 250)
        draw_text("Press S to Save, ESC to Exit", 250, 350)
        pygame.display.flip()
```

---

## ‚úÖ Result

When you open the editor, on the right side you‚Äôll see:

```
Selected: 3
0: Empty
1: Wall
2: Goal
3: Block
4: Player
Press S to Save, ESC to Exit
```

So you always know which number maps to which object.

---

üëâ Do you also want me to make it so the **name of the selected item** is shown, e.g. `Selected: 3 (Block)` instead of just `Selected: 3`?
